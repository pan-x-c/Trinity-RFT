# Frozen Lake Agent

This example shows the implementation of a Frozen Lake agent using the Agentscope framework. The agent is designed to navigate a frozen lake environment by interpreting observations and selecting appropriate actions.

The data preparation and environment setup are the same as those in the [GRPO Frozen Lake example](../grpo_frozen_lake/README.md). Please follow the instructions there to set up the environment and prepare the dataset.
