"""Megatron-specific checkpoint and weight sync helpers for Trinity.

These helper functions are called by `TrinityActorRolloutRefWorker` to
perform Megatron-specific operations that veRL 0.8's engine does not
provide natively:

- megatron_save_state_dict:    Save state dict for checkpoint sync
- megatron_upload_state_dict:  Upload state dict to Synchronizer (memory sync)
- megatron_sync_weight_nccl:   Broadcast params via NCCL

All functions receive the `engine` object (a McoreEngine instance from
`verl.workers.engine.megatron`) which exposes:
  - engine.module: the Megatron model
  - engine.get_per_tensor_param(): generator of (name, tensor) pairs
  - engine.save_checkpoint() / engine.load_checkpoint()

    """Save Megatron actor model state dict for checkpoint-based weight sync.

    Delegates to the engine's built-in ``save_checkpoint`` for proper
    distributed checkpoint handling, but temporarily restricts the
    checkpoint manager's ``checkpoint_save_contents`` to ``["model"]`` so
    that only the actor model parameters are written to disk -- optimizer
    and extra (rng / scheduler) states are skipped, since this path is
    used only for weight-sync to the rollout side, not for training
    resume. The save is wrapped with CheckpointMonitor notifications via
    the coordinator.

    Note: Megatron's save_checkpoint involves distributed barriers internally,
    so it runs synchronously. The coordinator's ``save_sync`` is used to add
    Monitor notifications without background threading.
